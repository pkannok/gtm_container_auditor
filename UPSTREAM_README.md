# GTM Audit Skill Pro

Installable GTM-only audit package backed by the same runtime bundled in GTM AI
and Fix Your Tracking. This release replaces the marketplace's previously missing
source with a scoped implementation; the earlier advertised 72-checkpoint engine
was not present and is not represented as implemented here.

```text
/plugin marketplace add Organized-AI/plugin-marketplace
/plugin install gtm-audit-pro@organized-ai-marketplace
```

These commands use the published marketplace; local branch changes must be
published before those commands install this release. In a checkout, load the
local plugin using your client's supported local-plugin installation mechanism.

## Agent prompt

Use GTM Audit Skill Pro to audit my selected GTM container before the workshop.
Read the bundled setup reference, verify Node.js 22, and create a persistent
config outside the plugin cache. Reuse my approved read-only token provider or
a complete container export. Run the audit and give me its report and top three
questions. If I request background monitoring, start the watcher, verify status,
and give me the stop command. Enable candidate optimization only if I request it.
Do not import or publish candidates.

## Capabilities

- Deterministic static checks across references, duplicates, naming, hygiene,
  legacy UA tags, and folders; honest skipped-check reporting.
- Complete paginated workspace reads or the current published container version.
- Stable-snapshot polling, persistent state, per-target locking, bounded retries,
  and start/status/stop commands.
- Optional model proposals for names and folder organization, with strict
  keep/revert evaluation on local candidates.
- Container Atlas with an Audit tab (every web and server element marked broken,
  not firing, orphaned, drifted, duplicated or untested, using the published
  gtm.js and an optional live browser scan) and a GTM auto tab that runs the
  Autoresearch loop in the page: `node CLI atlas OUT.html web.json server.json
  --compiled gtm.js --observed scan.json`.

See [full setup](skills/gtm-autoresearch-loop/references/audit-integration.md) for
authentication, model adapters, source selection, and host requirements. MCP
login alone does not provision background Google API authentication.

Run `node --test skills/gtm-autoresearch-loop/scripts/runtime/test/*.test.mjs`.
The runtime is maintained in `gtm-ai-plugin/skills/gtm-autoresearch-loop` and
copied here unchanged.
